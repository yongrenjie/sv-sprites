# sv-sprites

Temporary sprites for SV Pokemon. Steps to obtain:

1. Download sprites from Serebii (the images are at the links https://www.serebii.net/pokedex-sv/icon/X.png where X ranges from 906 to 1010).
2. Trim transparent pixels from edges using https://github.com/martimlobao/pokesprite/blob/master/scripts/trim_dir.sh
3. Rename files to the appropriate Pokemon (see names.txt)

The script `get_all.py` does all of this.
